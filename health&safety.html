    <h1>Health&Safety</h1>
    <section>
      <h3>Our Commitment To Safety + Wellbeing:</h3>
      <p>
        We continue to closely monitor industry-leading health and safety
        recommendations and are doing everything we can to ensure the safety of
        our teams, our community and you. Here are some of the steps we are
        currently taking:
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Guest Protocol:</h3>
      <p>
        Protective masks and facial coverings will have to be worn by all staff
        and guests, as per the recent provincial health mandate. Masks are
        required at all times at the restaurant unless seated at the table.
      </p>
      <p>Dine-in services and patio seating is offered at our restaurant.</p>
      <p>
        Guests are asked to maintain 2m physical distancing rules while waiting
        for orders and to follow the flow path indicated by floor markings.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the time being there will be no shared condiment station, any
        milk/cream and sweetener is to be added by our masked staff member, lids
        will be provided and are to be attached by guests themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Water for guests can either be served in a single-use plastic cup or
        purchased in bottle form. There will not be a communal water station.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Hygiene + Cleaning Standards:</h3>
      <p>
        Our entire restaurant, including back-of-house and staff areas, will be
        thoroughly sanitized, deep cleaned and disinfected on a nightly basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        High-touch areas such as the front door handles, the espresso bar, the
        computer keyboards, payment pads and restroom faucets will be checked
        sanitized every 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>Our menu is displayed on the wall.</p>
      <p>
        All tables and chairs will be wiped down between use (including table
        tops, edges, legs, chair seat and chair back) with high-grade
        government-approved disinfectant.
      </p>
      <p>
        All staff are required to wash their hands every 30 minutes and to wear
        protective face masks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eigen-handled payment processors are used for payment processing, no
        cash is accepted at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Approved hand sanitizer stations are available at the front door and by
        the bathrooms for guests to use.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Prevention + Physical Distancing Measures:</h3>
      <p>
        Our staff are committed to daily health declarations indicating they are
        symptom-free.
      </p>
      <p>
        Floor markers have been applied to assist in the flow of foot traffic
        and ensure appropriate physical distancing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Operating procedures have been revised to fully comply with directives
        issued by Worksafe BC and the BC Provincial Health Office.
